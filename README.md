# MetaBow-Toolkit

A MaxMSP package developed by **James Bradbury** (University of Huddersfield) and **Roberto Alonso** (HKBU)

The MetaBow Toolkit is a set of abstractions designed around the MetaBow©, a violin bow interface developed by an international team of collaborators for MBow Ltd. The Toolkit is an intuitive MaxMSP package devised for composers and artists to develop interactive patches with different types of mapping possibilities. 
It includes clearly defined navigable sections such as general framework, extractors, sensor control, and abstraction processes.
